//Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd and for even numbers,
//whether the number ends with a zero.  Examples of what the display should look like are given below.
//For the integer 40:		Even number that ends in zero
//For the integer 4:		Even number
//For the integer 5:		Odd number
//Hint: An even number has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2.
